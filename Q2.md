# Q2

## Using the program

The final program is run as follows (with `file.txt` the name of a file with a list of words to process):

```
$ python anagram_detector.py <file.txt>
```

To run the tests:

```
$ python tests.py
```

See the following [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) screen cast with a demo:

## Background

Before beginning, I set some standards to rule out inconsistencies:

- input would be from a file - more consistent for testing and use
- ties in output ordering would be broken by original ordering in the file
- ordering of words on a single line would be based on original file ordering
- from input, blank lines, and leading and trailing spaces, would be stripped out and ignored
- duplicate input words would be ignored
- case of words would also be ignored, with everything normalized to lowercase
- spaces within the line would be kept, to allow for groups of words or phrases to be input and treated as one 'word'

The final behaviour of the program was based on these rules, the input and output requirements in the question, and the
example given.


## The TDD process


### Planning

I decided to use Python to implement the program in because it is a nice language, quick for implementing algorithms,
and includes a nice built-in unit testing framework.  With the git repo hosted on Github, I was able to use the Travis
CI (continuous integration) service to automatically run the tests on every git push to ensure the tests pass (and to
alert me if I forgot to test the code and ended up pushing non-working code to Github).

Current Travis tests status:  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swalladge/prt452-a1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swalladge/prt452-a1)

On the coding side, I decided to break the program into three functions:

1. load in a list of words from a file
2. process a list of words and group them
3. take the list of grouped words and format them for printing out


First, some files containing words were created to use in testing:

- no words (blank lines)
- words from the example
- words with uppercase letters
- phrases
- duplicate words
- finally, a file containing a larger number of anagrams (not used in the testing, but is nice for a demo)

Began actual coding by setting up the basic structure of the functions (without any functionality implemented), and the
tests framework.

### Loading words

Once everything was planned, I wrote two initial tests for loading words from a file:

- test_example_words: make sure it could successfully load the words as given in the example
- test_file_not_found: important to know that it will throw an error when the file given doesn't exist

Obviously these tests failed on first run, since the function wasn't implemented. So, I wrote code for that function
and tweaked it until it passed the tests. Once that was working, I wrote the rest of the tests for loading words:

- test_phrases: make sure it loads lines from the file containing phrases (even if words are only tested - need to
  handle edge cases)
- test_empty_file: make sure it doesn't crash on loading zero words from a file with no words (just blank lines)
- test_uppercase: make sure uppercase words are normalized to lowercase
- test_duplicates: make sure duplicate words are ignored, also tests duplicate words where case may be different

The words loading function didn't pass on the first time, so needed some work on it to correctly handle duplicates,
blank lines, and uppercase words.

### Grouping anagrams

Once the program was working properly for loading in a list of words, I started on getting it to group the anagrams
found in the words list. I wrote some tests to test the (yet to be implemented - currently a skeleton) anagram finding
function. For each test, a words list was given (identical to that which the loading words function would return) to
the function, and the output was compared with the expected output. A range of tests were used to try to catch any edge
cases:

- test_example_words: test the example from the question
- test_no_words: test finding anagrams on a list of zero words
- test_one_word: test with a single word
- test_single_anagram_group: test where all words were part of the same anagram group
- test_duplicate_words: make sure duplicate words were ignored by the function as well
- test_phrases: make sure phrases were handled as expected
- test_uppercase: make sure uppercase letters were normalized

With the tests all in place, I started coding on the anagram grouping function itself. With every change I ran the
tests against it, until all tests passed.


### Formatting anagrams

The final part was the function to format the grouped anagrams list into a list of lines to be able to print out. With
the specific rules about how the output should be formatted and ordered, tests were made with the list of grouped
anagrams as input to the function, and comparing the output against lists of how the formatted output should look. Note
that these expected outputs used in testing were produced by hand based on the question rules.

- test_example_words: the example words from the question
- test_no_words: list with no words
- test_one_word: list of only a single word
- test_single_anagram_group: list containing only one anagram group (multiple words in the group)
- test_phrases: groups of anagrams containing anagram phrases

Note that tests for upppercase and duplicates were not performed, as this function is expected to only take as its
input the list of groups of anagrams as output by the anagram finder function.


Using these tests, and the rules, the function was implemented, and worked on until all tests passed.


### End notes

- Since the tests were created by hand, there were a couple that contained typos and needed to be fixed once
  discovered. 
- One final test was added at the end that tested all three function together with the example from the question to
  ensure they all worked together well.
- Some extra code was written in the program to allow the program to be run on the command line. This part simply includes some code
  to get the file name from the program arguments, calls each of the anagram functions in turn, and finally
  prints the output. Since the core functionality was already tested with the automated tests described above, this part
  was able to be tested by hand to ensure it brought the functions together properly.
