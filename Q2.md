# Q2

## Background

Before beginning, I set some standards to rule out inconsistencies:

- input would be from a file - more consistent for testing and use
- ties in output ordering would be broken by original ordering in the file
- from input, blank lines, and leading and trailing spaces, would be stripped out and ignored
- duplicate input words would be ignored
- case of words would also be ignored, with everything normalized to lowercase
- spaces within the line would be kept, to allow for groups of words or phrases to be input and treated as one 'word'

The final behaviour of the program was based on these rules, the input and output requirements in the question, and the
example given.


## The TDD Process

### Planning

To begin with, it was decided to break the program into three functions:

1. load in a list of words from a file
2. process a list of words and group them
3. take the list of grouped words and format them for printing out


First, some files containing words were created to use in testing:

- no words (blank lines)
- words from the example
- words with uppercase letters
- phrases
- duplicate words
- finally, a file containing a larger number of anagrams (not used in the testing, but is nice for a demo)

Began actual coding by setting up the basic structure of the functions (without any functionality implemented), and the
tests framework.

### Loading words

Once everything was planned, I wrote two initial tests for loading words from a file:

- test_example_words: make sure it could successfully load the words as given in the example
- test_file_not_found: important to know that it will throw an error when the file given doesn't exist

Obviously these tests failed on first run, since the function wasn't implemented. So, I wrote code for that function
and tweaked it until it passed the tests. Once that was working, I wrote the rest of the tests for loading words:

- test_phrases: make sure it loads lines from the file containing phrases (even if words are only tested - need to
  handle edge cases)
- test_empty_file: make sure it doesn't crash on loading zero words from a file with no words (just blank lines)
- test_uppercase: make sure uppercase words are normalized to lowercase
- test_duplicates: make sure duplicate words are ignored, also tests duplicate words where case may be different

The words loading function didn't pass on the first time, so needed some work on it to correctly handle duplicates,
blank lines, and uppercase words.

### Grouping anagrams
