_What are the benefits of using change request form as the central document in
the change management process?_


Change management is about managing how and what changes are made to "acheive
the required business outcome".
(Prosci Inc. 2016)

A change request form is a powerful tool for requesting that a change be made.
The form will contain fields relating to the type of change, description of the
change, reason for requesting the change, and other needed fields. Some of these
are to be filled out by the person requesting the change, and others are for use
by the project team later. (Project Management Docs 2016)

Using a change request form has many advantages.

Firstly, it provides an accessible way for anyone to ask for a change to be made
in the software, whether it be a user, project team member, or any other
stakeholder.
If someone identifies the need for a change, either by discovering a bug,
wanting a new feature, or some other reason, he can fill out a change request
form with all the relevant information and submit it to the project team.

Then, that form becomes a central document containing information about that
change. The project team can view the document and decide how to proceed. For
example, the change request could be accepted and work begins on implementing
the change, or rejected for some reason.
This is beneficial, because it provides a central location for all the
information about the change request, along with associated risks, who requested
the change, people assigned to implementing parts of it, and so on.
