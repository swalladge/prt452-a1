_What are the benefits of using change request form as the central document in
the change management process?_

---

Change management is about managing how and what changes are made to "achieve
the required business outcome".
(Prosci Inc. 2016)

A change request form is a tool used for requesting that a change be made.  It
is a form (either paper or electronic), that contains fields relating to the
type of change, description of the change, reason for requesting the change, and
other needed fields. Some of these are to be filled out by the person requesting
the change, and others are for use by the project team later. (Project
Management Docs 2016)

Using a change request form as a central document has many advantages.

Firstly, it provides an accessible way for anyone to ask for a change to be made
in the software, whether it be a user, project team member, or any other
stakeholder.
If someone identifies the need for a change, either by discovering a bug,
wanting a new feature, or some other reason, he can fill out a change request
form with all the relevant information and submit it to the project team.

Then, that form becomes a central document containing information about that
change. The project team can view the document and decide how to proceed. For
example, the change request could be accepted and work begins on implementing
the change, or rejected based on project goals.
This is beneficial, because it provides a central location for all the
information about the change request.

The form also provides a place to record things like:

- risks
- schedule
- resources required
- budget
- list of other related documents
- priority

(Kempter 2016)

The document can be continually updated as changes are made by the project team,
or related issues are uncovered. Other relevant information can be added along
the way as well to track progress and keep everyone up to date on progress made
with the changes.

Finally, when the changes relating to the change request are completed, the
document can be signed off and archived for future reference if needed. It will
contain a full record of everything relating to the change that was made, from
who submitted the request and why, to exactly what changes were made and when.

A change request form used as a central document in this way becomes a powerful
too to manage, track, and process changes.
